## Contribution & Development

The website is built using [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Please make sure you have it installed locally. Additionally, you need [Node v16](https://nodejs.org/en/). Styling is done via Bootstrap and code blocks use Prism.js.

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build all assets
npm run dev

# Serve the website locally
npm run serve
```

I may decline contributions for large content or style changes. Make sure to talk to me before starting to work. Spelling and grammar corrections are always welcome.
