title: The LinkAce Community
---

LinkAce has a dedicated **[Community Discussions]({{< param "Community" >}})** where you can

* talk about the project general and post your experiences with it.
* share feedback with me and post requests for new features or improvements.
* post help requests if you have issues or need support.


### Community Rules

* Remember the human. When you communicate online, all you see is a computer screen. When talking to someone you might 
want to ask yourself "Would I say it to the person's face?".
* Adhere to the same standards of behavior online that you follow in real life.
* Be patient. Open Source projects such as LinkAce do not have any staff dedicated to answer your help requests.
* Be thankful. If other users or I as a maintainer help you, be thankful for the help and don't take it as granted.
