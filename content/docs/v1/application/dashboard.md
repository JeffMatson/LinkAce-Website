The Dashboard is the first screen you see after logging into LinkAce. It display the last few saved links, a mini form
for adding a new link quickly, as well as some numeric stats of your link database.

### Link Quick Adding

The top form allows you to quickly add a link with the default settings, without a distracting UI and without setting
tags or categories. The link may be edited later on.
