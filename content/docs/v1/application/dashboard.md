The Dashboard is the first screen you see after logging into LinkAce. It display the last few saved links, a mini form
for adding a new link quickly, as well as some numeric stats of your link database.

### Link Quick Adding

The top form allows you to quickly add a link with the default settings, without a distracting UI and without setting tags or categories. The link may be edited later on.

### Recent Links

On the left side of the dashboard you can find the five most recent links for quick access.

### Your LinkAce Statistics

On the right side, statistics about your LinkAce setup will be shown. They include the number of links, lists, tags, notes and number of broken links. Broken links are those with a bad status: they are either unreachable or have been moved.
