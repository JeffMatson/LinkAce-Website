LinkAce offers a lot of options to customize your bookmarking experience. Here is the overview for all user specific settings which are accessible from the user drop down menu in the menu bar.
 
## The Bookmarklet

{{< image type="screen" img="user_settings_bookmarklet.png" alt="Preview of the bookmarklet settings" >}}

The Bookmarklet is one of the most important features as it provides a simple way to add a random website to LinkAce as a link without leaving the website. To use the Bookmarklet, drag the button to your browser bookmarks bar.

While on a website you want to save to LinkAce, click the Bookmarklet. This will open a popup. This popup will show a login page if you are not logged in on LinkAce, or the pre-filled link form.


## The API Token

For sure LinkAce also lets you change your user details and your password. You can change both in the Account Settings panel, or the Change Password panel.


## User Settings

### Wayback Machine backups

{{< image type="screen" img="user_settings_wayback_machine.png" alt="Preview of the Wayback Machine settings" >}}

LinkAce supports backing up your links with the help of the Wayback Machine. Instead of storing data locally, the app relies on more of a decade of experience of the Internet Archive foundation to store websites and their contents.

Please notice, that some websites restrict access of the Wayback Machine. If that's the case, the website will not be archived. Please contact the site owner to get access for the Wayback Machine.

By default, LinkAce won't try to backup links that are marked as "private". This can be changed by enabling the corresponding setting.


### Privacy settings

Privacy is quite important if you enabled guest mode. Whether you enable or disable the default behavior for links, lists, tags or notes, you can make them private or public while creating or editing them.

{{< table >}}

| Option | Description |
|:------|:------------|
| Private Links by default | If enabled, all new links will be private by default. |
| Private Lists by default  | If enabled, all new Lists will be private by default. |
| Private Tags by default  | If enabled, all new Tags will be private by default. |
| Private Notes by default  | If enabled, all new notes will be private by default. |

| Permanently Enabled | The dark theme will always be disabled. |

### Link Sharing
