title: LinkAce Setup
---

LinkAce itself does not require a high-performance server to run at. Indeed, there is just this PHP app that needs access to a database.

{{< alert type="danger" >}}
There will be **no** support for environments which do not meet the requirements!
{{</ alert >}}


## Continue with the setup

If you are confident your environment meets the requirements, continue with the setup:

* [Setup with Docker]({{< relref path="docs/v1/setup/setup-with-docker/_index.md" >}})
* [Setup without Docker]({{< relref path="docs/v1/setup/setup-without-docker.md" >}})


## Setup with SQLite

{{< alert type="warning" >}}
By default, LinkAce requires using MySQL or PostgreSQL for the regular setup. To use SQLite, please follow the specific [SQLite instructions]({{< relref path="docs/v1/setup/setup-with-sqlite.md" >}}).
