LinkAce itself does not require a high-performance server to run at. Indeed, there is just this PHP app that needs access to a database.

There will be **no** support for environments which do not meet the requirements!

## Continue with the setup

If you are confident your environment meets the requirements, continue with the setup:

* [Setup with Docker]({{< relref path="docs/v1/setup/setup-with-docker.md" >}})
* [Setup without Docker]({{< relref path="docs/v1/setup/setup-without-docker.md" >}})
