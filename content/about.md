title: About LinkAce
---

LinkAce is a self-hosted web application for managing a bookmark archive. I built this tool to have something that fits
my actual needs which other bookmark managers couldn't solve.

The primary intention of the application is to provide a solid solution to archive links and organize them. Those links
may be added from the web application, the bookmarklet, or a third-party application via the API.

#### Features

* Automated link checks to make sure your bookmarks stay available.
* Automated “backups” of your bookmarks via the Waybackmachine.
* Titles and descriptions are generated automatically.
* Organize bookmarks in lists to bundle them to broader topics, and tags to add detailed categorization.
* A bookmarklet to quickly save links from any browser is built into the app.
* Links can , so friends or internet strangers can see your collection.
* Add unlimited notes to links to add thoughts.
* Advanced search including different filters and ordering links.
* Import existing bookmarks from HTML exports from your browser.
* Support for complete database and app backups to Amazon AWS S3.
* A built-in light and dark color scheme.


## Roadmap

Version 1.0 of LinkAce will be a first major version of the app containing all features I need and want to use. At the 
moment, there are no plans to release a new major version in the near future. If you need new features you may request
them via the issue tracker or the Reddit or Spectrum community, but do not expect them being developed within a week.

Please keep in mind that LinkAce is offered for free because I think that others might find the tool useful.
Act accordingly.
