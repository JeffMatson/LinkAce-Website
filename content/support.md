title: Support for LinkAce
---

Free support is highly limited for all my free tools, including LinkAce. If you need help please visit the 
[community forum](/community) and post your issue there. I do not offer free personal support via chat or email.  
Please notice that LinkAce has specific requirements to run correctly.

If you need prioritized support you can **become a [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/Kovah)** 
or **[Github Sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/Kovah)**. ⭐️

## In case you need help

Nothing goes exactly as planned. There can be small, hidden problems with LinkAce, or the app is not entirely compatible
with your system.

Before posting a new help requests to the Github repository or in the communities, please take a look at the 
[documentation](/docs/v1).


### Posting bug reports

The Github repository is intended to track the development status **and not for support requests!** If you need help
without knowing that there is a specific issue with LinkAce itself, please use the [community channels](/community) 
instead.

If you want to report a bug within the application, please open a new [issue]({{< param "Github" >}})
and describe:

* which version you are using,
* what your exact problem is,
* and what you already did to solve the problem.
