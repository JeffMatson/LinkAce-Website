title: Support for LinkAce
---

LinkAce is a private side-project mainly developed for *myself*. I develop the app in my free time and do not expect
any payment from users.

{{< alert type="danger" >}}

* I do not offer any paid support. Free support is available from the community.
* I do not offer any free or paid installation help.
* I do not offer any free or paid customization for single users.

{{</ alert >}}

If you need an app with extensive support please consider using a commercial solution.


## In case you need help

Nothing goes exactly as planned. There can be small, hidden problems with LinkAce or the app is not entirely compatible
with your system.

Before posting a new help requests to the Github repository or in the communties, please take a look at the 
[documentation](/docs/v1).


### Get support from the community

You can post support requests in the [Spectrum chat]({{< param "Chat" >}}) or in the [Reddit community]({{< param "Reddit" >}}).

Please be as detailed as possible and post logs if they are available.


### Posting bug reports

The Github repository is intended to track the development status **and not for support requests!** If you need help
without knowing that there is a specific issue with LinkAce itself, please use the [community channels](/community) 
instead.

If you want to report a bug within the application, please open a new [issue]({{< param "Github" >}})
and describe:

* which version you are using,
* what your exact problem is,
* and what you already did to solve the problem.
